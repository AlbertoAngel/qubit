<p>QuBit is a library to support Quantum Superpositions in C++. This allows each <i>CQuBit</i> variable to hold a number of
different values <i>at the same time</i>. Normal mathematical operations can be performed on a QuBit, but they affect every value
in the QuBit, <i>at the same time</i>. Binary Operations on two QuBits cause a result based on <i>every</i> possible outcome.
For example, </p>
<TABLE CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2" BORDER="1">
<TR><TD>a = { 1, 2, 3 };</TD><TD>b = a + 10;</TD><TD>b = { 11, 12, 13 };</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>a = { 2, 4, 6 }; b = { 10 ,100 ,1000 };</TD><TD>c = a * b;</TD><TD>c = { 20, 40, 60, 200, 400, 600, 2000, 4000, 6000 };</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<i>This is pseudo-code for demonstrative purposes only! The C++ comes later!</i>
<p>Each value can only exist in a QuBit once. There is no 'weighting' applied if a value is added several times.</p>
<p>Comparisons with a QuBit also occur with all the values <i>at the same time</i>. This means a search is simply,</p>
<TT>
qb = (1,2,3,4,5);<BR>
if qb eq 5  print "There's a '5' in the QuBit, somewhere!"<BR>
</TT>

<b><a name="quantum">Quantum Stuff</a></b>
<p>The above examples demonstrate the basic functionality of QuBit. It's not significantly more complex than 'sets'. However,
there are a few functions that take the extra step into 'gaga' land!</p>
<p>A QuBit can be in three possible states:</p>
<UL>
	<LI>Disjunctive</LI>
	<LI>Conjunctive</LI>
	<LI>Collapsed</LI>
</UL>
<p><U>Disjunctive</U><BR>
All states are considered when performing arithmetic (at the same time, remember!), but
this not necessarily true of comparisons. A disjunctive QuBit will consider that if <i>any</i> of 
the individual comparisons evaluate to 'true', the whole expression will evaluate to 'true'. In psuedo-code:</p>
if any{10,15,20,25} < 20 then print "At least one of these numbers is lower than 20"<BR>

<p><U>Conjunctive</U><BR>
Here, a comparison will evaluate to 'true' if <i>all</i> it's individual values evaluate to 'true'.
In psuedo-code:</p>
if all{10,15,20,25} < 20 then print "All of these numbers are lower than 20"<BR>

<p><U>Collapsed</U><BR>
This occurs ofter a comparison has been made. The QuBit has exhausted all it's superpositions to produce the
result, and is consequently empty. It does, however, contain a 'true' or 'false' value, dependent on the result. 
(You'll see how this boolean result is obtained later)</p>

<p><U>Eigenstates</U><BR>
A collapsed quantum state is useful - but not that useful! It might be useful to know that there is
(at least) one number less than 20 in a particular case, but it would be <i>more</i> useful to know
<i>which</i> numbers are less than 20. To find this information, we use the eigenstates of the QuBit. Pseudo-code, anyone?</p>
v = any{10,15,20,25} < 20<BR>
if v then print "Those numbers less than 20 are " eigenstates(v)<BR>

<BR><HR WIDTH="50%"><BR>

<B><a name="cqubit">Declaring and Using a QuBit</a></b>
<p>We now turn to the actual C++ code require to perform these Quantum miracles! QuBit is, itself, a template and is
therefore created with:</P>
<TT>CQuBit&lt;float&gt; q;</TT><BR>
<p>This declares a Quantum superposition called 'q', consisting of floating point numbers. To add or remove values to this
variable, you may use the following functions:</p>
<TT>
&nbsp;q.Add(10);	// Add '10'<BR>
&nbsp;q.Add(2);	// Add '2'<BR>
&nbsp;q.AddRange(100,200);	// Add every number from '100' to '200', inclusive<BR>
&nbsp;q.AddRange(10,11,0.1f);	// Add every number from '10' to '11' in steps of '0.1'<BR>
&nbsp;q.Remove(10.5f);		// Remove the number '10.5'<BR><BR>
</TT>
You can also construct a QuBit, using the ranged constructor,<BR>
<TT>CQuBit&lt;float&gt; q(100,200);	// exactly the same as example three above</TT><BR>
<p>Use of QuBit is the same as any other variable. Since all (<a href="#probs">see note below</a>) operators are overloaded
you can write natural looking code, such as 'a+b', or 'a/=2'. You can use binary operations (such as additional or multiplication)
with either one CQuBit and one float, or two CQuBits, as you see fit. Note <a href="#probs">restrictions</a>.</p>

<BR><HR WIDTH="50%"><BR>

<B><a name="qfn">Quantum-Orientated Member Functions</a></b>
<p>
Having created a quantum superposition (with either <TT>Add</TT> or <TT>AddRange</TT>), it is now time to use it. Looking at
the examples above, we can find if any value is less than 20 with this code.</p>
<TT>
CQuBit&lt;float&gt; q(10,25,5);<BR>
CQuBit&lt;float&gt; ans;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;ans = q.Any() < 20;<BR>
&nbsp;if (ans.GetBoolResult()) cout << "At least one of these numbers is lower than 20";<BR>
</TT>
<p>The QuBit can also be treated as a disjunctive with the code <TT>q.Any();</TT>, allowing you to re-write the above thus:</p>
<TT>
CQuBit&lt;float&gt; q(10,25,5);<BR>
CQuBit&lt;float&gt; ans;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;q.Any();<BR>
&nbsp;ans = q < 20;<BR>
&nbsp;if (ans.GetBoolResult()) cout << "At least one of these numbers is lower than 20";<BR>
</TT>
<p>Although the results of the comparison (i.e. q < 20) is boolean, the C++ version of the library
forces the result type to be a CQuBit. You then determine whether it collapsed to 'true' or 'false' with the
'GetBoolResult()' member function. This is to allow retrieval of the eigenstates (if only a bool were returned
this information would get lost). Using eigenstatees to find those values less than 20, one can use:<p>
<TT>
CQuBit&lt;float&gt; q(10,25,5);<BR>
CQuBit&lt;float&gt; ans;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;q.Any();<BR>
&nbsp;ans = q < 20;<BR>
&nbsp;if (ans.GetBoolResult()) cout << "These numbers are lower than 20: " << ans.Eigenstates();<BR>
</TT>
<p>The <TT>Eigenstates</TT> function returns a QuBit itself, so could be applied to further calculations.</p>
<p><i>Note:</i>Eigenstates could have been implemented in a similar fashion to PERL, with a cache storing
the result of the last comparison operation. However, as it didn't feel very
'C' to be using global variables in this manner, so I adopted a QuBit return type, and 'GetBoolResult' to 
retrieve the comparisons' result. (Technically speaking this might also be considered storing a global!)</p>
<p><TT>All</TT> is used in exactly the same manner as above. Only the results differ (obviously!).</p>
<TT>
CQuBit&lt;float&gt; q(10,25,5);<BR>
CQuBit&lt;float&gt; ans;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;q.All();<BR>
&nbsp;ans = q < 20;<BR>
&nbsp;if (ans.GetBoolResult()) cout << "All of these numbers are lower than 20: ";<BR>
</TT>

<BR>
<u>Streams</u>
<p>The output stream produces space delimitted list of the states, enclosed in braces. </p>
<TT>
CQuBit&lt;float&gt; q;<BR>
&nbsp;q.AddRange(15,20);<BR>
&nbsp;cout << q;<BR>
</TT>
<i>produces</i>
{ 15 16 17 18 19 20 }<BR>
<p>The input stream, will read this format into the QuBit, and leave the stream pointer immediately
after the closing brace.</p>

<BR><HR WIDTH="50%"><BR>

<p><B><a name="setfn">Set-Orientated Member Functions</a></b><BR>
The <TT>Any</TT> and <TT>All</TT> methods have another function: set manipulation. Recall that QuBits
is basically an implementation of set handling. Also recall, that <TT>Any</TT> is disjunctive. So,
if <i>any</i> of {1,2,3} is combined with <i>any</i> of {4,5,6}, the result is a union; {1,2,3,4,5,6}. 
Written in code, this would be:</p>
<TT>
CQuBit&lt;float&gt; q1(1,3);<BR>
CQuBit&lt;float&gt; q2(4,6);<BR>
CQuBit&lt;float&gt; ans;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;ans.Any(q1, q2);&nbsp;// The result is {1,2,3,4,5,6}<BR>
</TT> 
<p><i>Note:</i> QuBit ignores the type of original quantum states. So in this case, <TT>q1</TT> and <TT>q2</TT>
could be conjunctive or disjunctive, the answer would be identical in both cases. All collapsed QuBits are
ignored</p>
<p>Well, <TT>Any</TT> is union, it should be obvious what <TT>All</TT> (the conjunctive state) should be! One
brownie point to everyone who said 'intersection'. The resultant QuBit features only those values present in
<i>both</i> of the original superpositions.</p>
<TT>
CQuBit&lt;float&gt; q1(1,6);<BR>
CQuBit&lt;float&gt; q2(4,5);<BR>
CQuBit&lt;float&gt; ans;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;ans.All(q1, q2);&nbsp;// The result is {4,5}<BR>
</TT>

<a name="probs"><B>Limitions</b>
<p>QuBits are only concerned with values. Therefore, the return value from post and pre decrement operators are identical. i.e.
<i>a++</i> and <i>++a</i>, are the same as <i>a++</i>. This <b>doesn't</b> mean that <i>a++</i> and <i>++a</i>
are different, just that the return type from <i>a++</i> is a value (as it should be), but <i>++a</i> is <b>not</b>
a reference to the <i>a</i> variable, as you might expect.</p>
<TABLE CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0" BORDER="1">
<TR><TD>a = {1,2,3}</TD><TD>b = a++;</TD><TD>a = {2,3,4}; b = {1,2,3};</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>a = {1,2,3}</TD><TD>b = ++a;</TD><TD>a = {2,3,4}; b = {2,3,4};</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<p>Some compilers (noticable Microsoft's!) refuse to compile this code as is. To help those poor
unfortunates, I've removed a couple of the friend functions with an <i>#if 0</i>. Namely,</p>
<UL>
<LI>friend  CQuBit<_T> operator+(const _T &a, const CQuBit<_T> &b)</LI>
<LI>friend  CQuBit<_T> operator*(const _T &a, const CQuBit<_T> &b)</LI>
<LI>friend  CQuBit<_T> operator-(const _T &a, const CQuBit<_T> &b)</LI>
</UL>
<p>These prevent compilation of code such as, <i>q2 = 5 * q1</i>. This means you'll have to re-write your code by swapping 
the arguments over, or by creating a QuBit containing one entry. The code works, however.
</p>
<p>The set of operators catered for are:</p>
